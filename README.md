# 100-math Challenge!
Find *all possible equations* that is resulted to *100*, from operating the ordered number [1,2,3,...,9] with [+, -, *, /].

### Example output equations
- 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8*9 = 100
- 1/2*3/4*56+7+8*9 = 100
- 123+4*5-6*7+8-9 = 100
- ...

### Extra scores
- Try to coding without using any packages.
- Try to optimize with *Multi-processing* and/or *Multi-threading*.
- Try to change the final result, non-ordered numbers, characters, etc.
